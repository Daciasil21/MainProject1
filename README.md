# KnowGo
<h2> Know the safety rating of a venue in Austin before you go to events. </h2>
<p> This app is useful for a variety of needs, such as newcomers to Austin, people wanting to check out Austin's bustling night scenes while remaining informed, and Parents who want to keep their children within safe areas while enjoying the events. </p>
<p> The crime density of an event area is represented by a 'grade' (A being the safest and C being the least safe) as well as a one mile diameter circle colored green (safest) to red (least safe). </p>

<h3> Behind the secenes of KnowGo </h3>
<h4> KnowGo utilizes several APIs in its inner workings. </h4>
<ul>
<li> Google maps serves as the backdrop of the app where events and crime data are mapped. </li>
<li> Information from Data.Gov was used to track and display crime data. A ranking system of the crimes, such as making murder a graver crime than public intoxication, was also used. </li>
<li> Eventful, a website that lists events within an area, was used to populate the map with events and their information. Users can easily filter the results of the events by type (family, sports, music, and all) to match their needs. </li>
